# Install chrome stable from sources, then remove it. Why? The
# npm install of `puppeteer` brings its own bundle chromium build,
# and puppeteer releases are only guaranteed to work with that version.
#
# But the bundled chromium implicitly needs a bunch of shared libs on
# the host. It's a little tedious to find and maintain that list; but
# the official apt distro of `google-chrome-stable` should bring the right
# set along. So do that, but immediately uninstall (to free up layer space).
#
# This is a little brittle, since the puppeteer chrome could in theory diverge
# from the official apt chrome's shared lib deps. But it works..
